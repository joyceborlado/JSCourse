Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm fundamental to many programming languages, including Java and C++. In this article, we'll provide an overview of the basic concepts of OOP. We'll describe three main concepts: classes and instances, inheritance, and encapsulation. For now, we'll describe these concepts without reference to JavaScript in particular, so all the examples are given in pseudocode.

Object-oriented programming is about modeling a system as a collection of objects, where each object represents some particular aspect of the system. Objects contain both functions (or methods) and data. An object provides a public interface to other code that wants to use it but maintains its own private, internal state; other parts of the system don't have to care about what is going on inside the object.
