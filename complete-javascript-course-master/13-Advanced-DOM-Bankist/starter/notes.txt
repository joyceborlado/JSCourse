/// DOM (document object model)

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

HTML DOM Methods

HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).

HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.

The DOM Programming Interface
The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).

In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).

The getElementById Method
The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.

In the example above the getElementById method used id="demo" to find the element.

The innerHTML Property
The easiest way to get the content of an element is by using the innerHTML property.

The innerHTML property is useful for getting or replacing the content of HTML elements.

The innerHTML property can be used to get or change any HTML element, including <html> and <body>

===========HTML DOM DOCUMENTS=======================
The HTML DOM document object is the owner of all other objects in your web page.

The HTML DOM Document Object
The document object represents your web page.

If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.

Below are some examples of how you can use the document object to access and manipulate HTML.
