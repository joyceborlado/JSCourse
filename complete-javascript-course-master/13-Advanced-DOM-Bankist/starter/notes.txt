/// DOM (document object model)

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

HTML DOM Methods

HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).

HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.

The DOM Programming Interface
The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).

In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).

The getElementById Method
The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.

In the example above the getElementById method used id="demo" to find the element.

The innerHTML Property
The easiest way to get the content of an element is by using the innerHTML property.

The innerHTML property is useful for getting or replacing the content of HTML elements.

The innerHTML property can be used to get or change any HTML element, including <html> and <body>

===========HTML DOM DOCUMENTS=======================
The HTML DOM document object is the owner of all other objects in your web page.

The HTML DOM Document Object
The document object represents your web page.

If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.

Below are some examples of how you can use the document object to access and manipulate HTML.

///////////Finding HTML Elements////////////////
Method
document.getElementById(id)	=> Find an element by element id
document.getElementsByTagName(name)	=> Find elements by tag name
document.getElementsByClassName(name) => Find elements by class name


////////////Changing HTML Elements////////////////
Property	Description
element.innerHTML =  new html content	Change the inner HTML of an element
element.attribute = new value	Change the attribute value of an HTML element
element.style.property = new style	Change the style of an HTML element
Method	Description
element.setAttribute(attribute, value)	Change the attribute value of an HTML element


/////////////////Adding and Deleting Elements////////
Method	Description
document.createElement(element)	Create an HTML element
document.removeChild(element)	Remove an HTML element
document.appendChild(element)	Add an HTML element
document.replaceChild(new, old)	Replace an HTML element
document.write(text)	Write into the HTML output stream


============Finding HTML Elements==============
Often, with JavaScript, you want to manipulate HTML elements.

To do so, you have to find the elements first. There are several ways to do this:

Finding HTML elements by id
Finding HTML elements by tag name
Finding HTML elements by class name
Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors
Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections


Example:
const element = document.getElementById("intro");
const element = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
const x = document.getElementById("main");
const y = x.getElementsByTagName("p");
const x = document.getElementsByClassName("intro");
const x = document.querySelectorAll("p.intro");

const x = document.forms["frm1"];
let text = "";
for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
  text += x.elements[i].value + "<br>";
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;


The following HTML objects (and object collections) are also accessible:

document.anchors
document.body
document.documentElement
document.embeds
document.forms
document.head
document.images
document.links
document.scripts
document.title

Intersection observer options
The options object passed into the IntersectionObserver() constructor let you control the circumstances under which the observer's callback is invoked. It has the following fields:

root
The element that is used as the viewport for checking visibility of the target. Must be the ancestor of the target. Defaults to the browser viewport if not specified or if null.

rootMargin
Margin around the root. Can have values similar to the CSS margin property, e.g. "10px 20px 30px 40px" (top, right, bottom, left). The values can be percentages. This set of values serves to grow or shrink each side of the root element's bounding box before computing intersections. Defaults to all zeros.

threshold
Either a single number or an array of numbers which indicate at what percentage of the target's visibility the observer's callback should be executed. If you only want to detect when visibility passes the 50% mark, you can use a value of 0.5. If you want the callback to run every time visibility passes another 25%, you would specify the array [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]. The default is 0 (meaning as soon as even one pixel is visible, the callback will be run). A value of 1.0 means that the threshold isn't considered passed until every pixel is visible.
